# Recipe Website.

## Overview.
This is the second project I have build after the team management application to learn **react**. It is a recipe page where you can get information on variuos recipe fetched from an external API. This application has no backend and uses the browser `local storage` to keep tract of data.

## Tech stack.
- React.
- Vite.
- CSS.

## Learning.
After building two applications in react I feel a bit confident about building web applications in react. 

## Resources.
- [Official react website.](https://react.dev/)
- [React JavaScript Framework for Beginners â€“ Project-Based Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6gSSpfsoOQ&t=6613s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org): I have build the above application by following along this turorial on freeCodeCamp. Here three well experienced developers teach you react through a project based approach where each of them helps you build an application.
